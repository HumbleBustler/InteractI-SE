# QR Code Based Attendance System

Software dependencies:

Here we have used Python 3.7.1 with libraries qrcode, openpyxl and pandas

1. pip install openpyxl

2. pip install pandas

3. pip install qrcode

Notes:

You can scan QR Codes with any app preferably with bulk scanner like "AdobeScan or LoMag barcode scanner(http://www.lomag.eu/ScannerAndroid/)"

This system is made to make taking attendance easier and more reliant.
