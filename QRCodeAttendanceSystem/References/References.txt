The python implementation of this project was in part influenced by the Open Sourced project
mentioned below. The implementation saved decent time in development phase which contributed to more time in 
testing and aided in removing a critical design flaw early in development of QR-Code to be scanned by student
which was later changed to QR-Code to be scanned by faculty as it removes almost all
possibility of marking fake attendance by sharing QR-Codes (in earlier design).
